# Tabular 

## A framework for easily creating spreadsheet-like web applications with a functional programming style API.

Tabular will allow you to create an application with editable rows/columns of data with about
20 lines of code plus an array that defines the column attributes.  You can filter the data, search it, and
all your data inserts/updates/deletes are recorded in the database.

At the moment what's here is just a subset of the framework that encapsulates the database, dealing with
CSV files, sets and some filtering operations.  More to come...
